# Epicodus-Intro-to-Web-Building
Introductory class on building a web page using java and html

- I attended a class where I learned the basics of creating a web page using Java and HTML.
- Using a script editor (we used Atom in this class), open the files

## Index.html
- This gives you the basic structure of how the page will render.
- Our page is broken into head and body placements with an image of a path on the rightside of the page.
- There's also an option of including goals with a button click

## Styles.css
- This file refers back to the Index.html and contains information on the style of the font and backgrounds.
- We list this information in a separate file and not directly in the Index.html so that our Index file will be easier to read.

## Scripts.js
- In this json file, we've created a function that appends any new goal a user inputted into the list once the user clicks on the button.
